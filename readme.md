# Custom Music Player
Make a custom music player website by downloading songs off of youtube.

## How to use it
1. TO use it first you have to make a txt file with a list of your songs I would suggest using tunemymusic.com to do that.
2. Then run it through the python script and obtain music-list.js
3. Keep music-list.js in the same folder as script.js and you have yourslef a custom music player on your browser.

Of course to make any edits to the design you can make changes to style.css
